## 2. Prompt Utilized  

Generate Mermaid code for a top-to-bottom flowchart of a Django or web application architecture. 

The diagram must include at a minimum:  
1. A Stakeholders subgraph (block) containing the expected multiple user groups. Each stakeholder group should have a label:  
   - `Primary Users (Collectors & Hobbyists)`  
   - `Secondary Users (Buyers & Sellers)`  
   - `Tertiary Users (Family, Friends & Club Members)`  
   - `Administrators (Governance / IT Staff)`  
   
2. Each stakeholder connects to the Backend node with a labeled edge showing the URL patterns or endpoints they use (to be further defined in future iterations).  
3. The Backend node should connect to:  
   - A Database node (with the technology specified as MySQL or MariaDB).  
   - An Image/File Storage node (File System, S3 Bucket, or Cloud Storage).  
4. Ensure the use of proper Mermaid syntax.  
5. Output only the final Mermaid code block.
