## 2. Prompt Utilized  

I require a project pitch to meet the requirements for a web application project utilizing Python, Django, Django DRF, and a SQL database such as SQLite, MySQL, or MariaDB. The preferred databases would be MySQL or MariaDB as they are currently available on my current IONOS web hosting service provider. Create a pitch outline that aligns with the directions for deliverables, submissions, and evaluations listed below from the assignment instructions:

### Deliverables
- 2–3 page memo (≈800–1,000 words): problem, stakeholders, scope, success metrics; define a minimal viable artifact shippable within 2 weeks.  
- System sketch: labeled diagram (block/sequence) showing front-end back-end data OR AI touchpoints.  
- Evidence base: at least 3 authoritative sources (industry reports, academic articles, standards). Use a consistent citation style.  
- Risk register: table of top 3 risks with mitigations.  

### Submission
- Include memo text and embedded/exported diagram in your PDF.  
- Link to any /docs/ materials in your GitHub repo.  

### Evaluation guide
- Clarity of problem framing and realism of scope  
- Design coherence & traceability from goals architecture  
- Evidence quality & integration  
- Communication quality (structure, clarity, citations)  

The project will progress with an iterative project methodology.  

The project will be for a "Mineral & Gemstone Collection Catalog" that supports uploading one or more images for each mineral record.  

Review this problem statement for structure, grammar, and professionalism:

> Collectors (hobbyists, traders, and club members) often track mineral specimens in ad-hoc spreadsheets with photos scattered across devices or none at all. This leads to missing provenance (where/when acquired), inconsistent naming, weak search, and no accessibility baseline for sharing catalogs with others. A small, structured Django app with image upload and basic metadata would provide collectors a reliable, searchable record, while establishing good accessibility and archival habits (e.g., descriptive alt text, consistent fields, basic metadata schema).

The stakeholders for this application are listed below. Review and ensure the descriptions match and adequately describe the primary, secondary, and tertiary stakeholders (users). Include a special category of stakeholder (user) for administration, noting that administrators may or may not be collectors.

Stakeholders: Primary: Individual collectors, amateur geologists or enthusiasts, lapidarists. Secondary: collectors as buyers/sellers (provenance, cost history, and selling pricing and sold data). Tertiary: Family members, club members who are interested in viewing a collector's cataloged collection.

Include in the project pitch a description of the data set best suited to such an application.

### Project Pitch Memo  

**Subject:** Mineral & Gemstone Collection Catalog Web Application  
**Author:** [Your Name]  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  

---

### Introduction  

This memo proposes the design and development of a web-based application—**Mineral & Gemstone Collection Catalog**—built using **Python, Django, Django REST Framework (DRF), and MySQL/MariaDB**. The system aims to provide mineral collectors, hobbyists, and amateur geologists with a structured, reliable, and accessible method of documenting their collections.  

The application addresses longstanding gaps in how collectors record specimen information. Many currently rely on ad-hoc spreadsheets and device-scattered photos, creating inconsistencies in provenance, naming, and metadata. This project introduces a structured catalog that supports **CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete), image upload, and accessibility-first design**.  

The following sections detail the **problem statement, stakeholders, project scope, minimal viable artifact (MVA), success metrics, dataset design, system sketch, evidence base, risk register, and evaluation alignment**.  

---

### Problem Statement  

Collectors (hobbyists, traders, and club members) often track mineral specimens in spreadsheets or handwritten logs, while photos are stored across devices—or not linked to catalog records at all. This fragmented approach produces several pain points:  

- **Loss of Provenance:** Specimen acquisition details (time, source, location) are often missing or inconsistent.  
- **Inconsistent Metadata:** Naming conventions vary, reducing data reliability and shareability.  
- **Poor Accessibility:** No standards for image labeling or descriptive alt text make catalogs difficult for visually impaired users or broader community engagement.  
- **Weak Search Capabilities:** Spreadsheet filters are limited, and image-based searching is absent.  

A structured Django-based application provides a professional, archival-quality platform that enables collectors to **build, search, and share their catalogs reliably and accessibly**.  

---

### Stakeholders  

- **Primary:** Individual collectors, amateur geologists, mineral enthusiasts, lapidarists.  
- **Secondary:** Collectors functioning as buyers/sellers who require provenance and cost history.  
- **Tertiary:** Family members, inheritors, or club members viewing catalogs.  
- **Administrative:** System administrators overseeing governance, account management, and integrity.  

---

### Scope and Minimal Viable Artifact (MVA)  

The scope balances feasibility within a graduate-level, 2–4 week timeframe while laying foundations for future iterations.  

**MVA Features (shippable within 2 weeks):**  
1. **User Accounts & Authentication** – Basic login, registration, and account management.  
2. **CRUD for Mineral Records** – Create, update, delete, and view mineral entries.  
3. **Image Upload & Storage** – Attach one or more photos per record with required alt text.  
4. **Search/Filter Functionality** – By mineral name, class, acquisition source, or date.  
5. **Accessibility Baseline** – Use of alt text, consistent labeling, and semantic HTML.  

**Future Iterations (beyond MVA):**  
- Advanced filters (hardness, streak, luster).  
- Multi-user collection sharing.  
- Marketplace integration (buy/sell tracking).  
- Mobile-first responsive design.

### Success Metrics  

1. **Usability:** Users can enter and retrieve records within three clicks, with no major navigation confusion during testing.  
2. **Data Quality:** At least 95% of entries contain complete metadata fields (e.g., mineral name, acquisition source, date).  
3. **Accessibility Compliance:** WCAG 2.1 AA standards followed for alt text and labeling.  
4. **Deployment Feasibility:** The app deploys successfully to IONOS-hosted MySQL/MariaDB within the given timeframe.  
5. **Performance:** Query responses under 2 seconds for datasets up to 5,000 records.

### Dataset Description  

**Core Entity: Mineral Record**  
- `specimen_id` (auto-generated unique identifier)  
- `mineral_name` (string, required)  
- `mineral_class` (silicate, oxide, carbonate, etc.)  
- `physical_attributes` (color, hardness, streak, luster, crystal system)  
- `acquisition_details` (source, date, method)  
- `financial_details` (purchase price, estimated value, selling price if applicable)  
- `provenance_notes` (free text field)  
- `images` (file path, alt text)  
- `owner_id` (user reference)  

This schema ensures traceability, archival quality, and structured provenance.
